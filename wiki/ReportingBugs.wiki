== Bug reports and feature requests ==

Thanks for taking the trouble to file a bug report.   Here are some things to keep in mind:

   * Before filing the report, please scan the list of issues to see if your report duplicates an issue that's already there.  If you like, you can click on the original report and add a comment, rather than creating a new issue.

   * If you are seeking help, rather than reporting a bug, you should generally be posting to the [[http://groups.google.com/group/appinventor App Inventor Group Forum] rather than using this bug report tool.  In any case, it's a good idea to scan the forum before reporting a bug, to see if other App Inventor community members have commented on the issue.

  * Some common issues people have with App Inventor, especially on Windows systems, have to do with finding drivers for particular Android devices.   Before posting a bug here, try searching the Web for information about Android or "Android SDK" and your device.
