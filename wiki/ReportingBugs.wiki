== Bug reports and feature requests ==

Thanks for taking the trouble to file a bug report.   Here are some things to keep in mind:

   * Before filing the report, please scan the list of issues to see if your report duplicates an issue that's already there. When you file a new issue, please select the appropriate template for reporting a bug, versus requesting a feature.  You can also click on the star  to vote on the issue as one that you'd like to see dealt with.  You can also click on the original report and add a comment, rather than creating a new issue.  You can also tell the system to send you email when the issue has been updated.

   * If you are seeking help (not just reporting a bug), you should generally post to the [http://groups.google.com/group/appinventor App Inventor Group Forum] rather than use this bug report tool. In any case, it's a good idea to search in the forum before reporting a bug, to see if other App Inventor community members have commented on the issue. 

  *  Some of the common issues people have with App Inventor involve trouble connecting the Android device to the computer, or installing drivers, or starting the Blocks Editor.  You should ask about these in the [http://groups.google.com/group/appinventor App Inventor Group Forum] rather than use this bug report tool.   Many of these issues  are not specific to App Inventor.   So try searching the Web  under "Android" or "Android SDK" and your particular device.   


*Before reporting an issue:* 
Before reporting an issue, please search the list of existing issues to see if a similar one has already been reported.  If so, add a comment or a star to the existing issue rather than filing a new issue.
